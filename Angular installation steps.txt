installation of Angular js
------------------------------

step 1: install node JS

Step 2 : check node JS version using in cmd/IDE(webstrom) using below command

node -v
version : 8.4.0

step 3: install NPM(node package manager) 
note: if we install node.js by default npm also will be installed on the system

Step 4: check npm  version using in cmd/IDE(webstrom) using below command

npm -v

step 5 : install angular cli on the system from cmd/IDE
command : npm install -g @angular/cli
note : -g stands global , if we use this option , one time installation of angular will be enough or else each time for each workspace we need to install angular/cli.

step 6:  check the version of angular/cli with below command
command: ng -version

step 7 : to create new angular project use the below command in the specific directory
ng new <project name>

step 8 : to run and deploy the angular project from project directory below command
ng serve


step 9 : to create new component the project.
ng g component <component name>

step 10 : to install bootstrap in to the project folder for nice css and styles
command : npm install --save bootstrap


step 11 : to skip creation of the spec/test file in a component.
command : ng g c <componentname> --spec false

step 12: to create component inside the component and not directly under app folder.
command : ng g c <parentcomponent>/<componentname> --spec false

step 13: if node-modules folder is missing in the project , we cannot run ng serve on that project so first we need to create node-modules folder in the project for that need to run below command in the project directory
command : npm install


step 14: To call the backend services we can use firebase which will generate dummy REST API for us along with database.
to create our own project with DB  in the firebase visit to 
http://firebase.google.com

step 15: To implement authentication in Angular we can use firebase authentication called firebase with SDK, for this usage we need to install firebase in our project
command: npm install --save firebase
